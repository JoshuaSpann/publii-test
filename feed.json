You parents live with you, sure, but they don't contribute or add income. You needs the greens, but without the golf. You're life is like Caddyshack.</p>\n<p>Time to get a website out there to show off your art skills in college. Maybe your hacking degree in university. Wait, a bare-minimum DOS server is <em>how many double 0's a month</em>?! A Raspberry Pi 0w is $10USD, why is a hosting plan with no insurance or encryption double the cost for half the resources?! Can you host it yourself? Sure, if you're fine with life being a joke and death the punchline when your internet goes down because \"power bills\". Nevermind, time to work at the taco ball down the street for 50% under minimum wage.</p>\n<p>You can do that there above, or you could do...</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dl555u8j0\">... this!</h3>\n<p>First off, <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/download/\">download Publii</a>. Yay, more Megs and less storage, another burden to bear. Install it. Next off, don't open it, get a <a href=\"https://github.com/join\">GitHub</a>. Wait, you have one? No wonder you're cheap by circumstance, all that open-source work and no patrons!</p>\n<p>Create a repo <em>with a README</em>, name it \"your account name dot github dot io\": <code>yourAccount.github.io</code>. Great, now open Publii. Add a new site. Once loaded go to the Server settings main menu option. Do something like this where <em>mii</em> is YOUR username. You'll probably need to get a token, <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/docs/host-static-website-github-pages.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publii has a guide</a> on that!</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://joshuaspann.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/7/publii-server-settings.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"985\" height=\"934\"></p>\n<p>Cool, you actually managed to follow outdated guides and it works. Save it. Now make some pages. Sync your changes. Boom, free website!</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dl56cevq0\">Optional, for the Less-Thrifty Cheapskates</h3>\n<p>Time goes on, you have some cash. Go get a domain name. Run some voodoo on your git repo settings and forward all DNS requests to GitHub's servers using <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain\">their guide</a>. Then <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain\">add it to your repo</a>. Yay, the cheapest hosting option available. Yeah, you can do GitLab and other sites, but GitHub just makes you <em>look</em> so professional...</p>",

Like any pro, you pick a random and easy-looking framework. Publii is one such tool that looks friendly, too friendly. So friendly that it doesn't do much. So how do you make it do more? Can you?</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dl52ngs90\">JavaScript</h3>\n<p>Luckily, Publii can do JavaScript. Publii has a source-code  <code>HTML </code> button. Go ahead, click it. Looks familiar? Now type in a <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag. You'll see the following below. Get the idea?</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://joshuaspann.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/6/publii-scripting-tag.png\" alt=\"Publii script tag\" width=\"709\" height=\"84\"></p>\n<p>But wait! That's an image! I'm fooling you! Nope, Publii generates HTML so you can safely assume that this inconspicuous <button id=\"alertButton\">button</button> <em>must</em> do <em>something</em>. Go ahead, click it. Seeing is believing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dl53l6d30\">CSS</h3>\n<p>Now Publii has very few decent themes on its own <a href=\"https://marketplace.getpublii.com/\" title=\"Publii Marketplace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Marketplace</a>. Seriously. Very. Few. With the <em>All</em> option selected, you get a whopping 15 total themes! Only 8 are free. Most of them are no-doubt good enough, but sometimes you need some flair and panache, ya know? Just a simple tweak to make that pic pop! Or to fix a glitch where the theme displays all images at FULL-SIZE, even when they obviously shouldn't.</p>\n<p>Simple! Go to the main menu on the left, to the bottom on <em>Tools</em>, then click on the <em>Custom CSS</em> button. There ya go. Simple as that!<img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://joshuaspann.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/6/publii-tools-css.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1476\" height=\"386\"></p>\n<p>Of course you could always do custom CSS by editing a post's HTML, but that's really not something to get into.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dl54hm5p0\">Dynamic Content</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, no. Publii is a <em>static</em> CMS generator, it makes pure HTML/JS/CSS only. Need a DB? Look at an API. Need to dynamically change and update page content? JQuery. Need a small web shop? Stop being cheap and upgrade to an actual server.</p>\n<p>\n<script>// <![CDATA[\nUnfor<br>// <![CDATA[\n[\nlet alertButton = document.querySelector('#alertButton')\n    alertButton.onclick = ()=> {\n    \talert('Hey there!
